so being dynamic and fast-moving is a piece of cake.  But being

get the right one, you can be like me.  If you get the wrong one, watch
out.

| 672-71-3249 | They asked me to write about
myself and my book, so here  es:  I started a restaurant called "de
Gustibus" with two of my friends.  We named it that because you really
can't discuss taste.  We're very popular with young business types
because we're young business types ourselves.  Whenever we tried to  
out to eat in a group we always  t into these long tiresome
ne tiations: "I just ate Italian," or "I ate Greek yesterday," or
I NEVER eat anything that's not organic!"  Inefficient.  Not what
business needs today.  So, it came to us that we needed a restaurant we
could allgo to every day and not eat the same thing twice in a row
maybe for a year!  We thought, "Hey, why make people choose one kind
of restaurant over another, when what they really want is a different
kind of food?"  At de Gustibus you can eat Italian, Chinese, Japanese,
Greek, Russian, Tasmanian, Iranian, and on and on all at the same
time.  You never have to choose.  You can even mix and match!  We just
pooled our recipes, opened the doors, and never looked back.  We're a
big hit, what can I say?  My recipes in "Sushi, Anyone?" are used at
de Gustibus.  They satisfy crowds for us every day.  They will work for
you, too.  Period! |
| 899-46-2035 | Anne Ringer ran away from the
circus as a child.  A university creative writing professor and her
family took Anne in and raised her as one of their own.  In this warm
and television-less setting she learned to appreciate the great
classics of literature.  The stream of aspiring and accomplished
writers that flowed constantly through the house confirmed her
repudiation of the circus family she'd been born into: "Barbarians!"
The steadily growing recognition of her literary work was, to her,
vindication.  When her brother's brush with death brought them together
after many years, she took advantage of life's crazy chance thing and
broke the wall of anger that she had constructed to separate them.
Together they wrote, "Is Anger the Enemy?" an even greater
blockbuster than her other collaborative work, with Michel DeFrance,
"The Gourmet Microwave."                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 998-72-3567 | Albert Ringer was born
in a trunk to circus parents, but another kind of circus trunk played a
more important role in his life years later.  He grew up as an
itinerant wrestler and roustabout in the reknowned Ringer Brothers and
Betty and Bernie's Circus.  Once known in the literary world only as
Anne Ringer's wrestling brother, he became a writer while recuperating
from a near-fatal injury received during a charity benefit bout with a 
gorilla.  "Slingshotting" himself from the ring ropes, Albert flew
over the  rilla's head and would have landed head first on the
concrete.  He was saved from certain death by Nana, an elephant he
befriended as a child, who caught him in her trunk.  Nana held him so
tightly that three ribs cracked and he turned blue from lack of
oxygen.  "I was delirious.  I had an out-of-body experience!  My whole
life passed before me.  I promised myself 'If I get through this, I'll
use my remaining time to share what I learned out there.'  I owe it all
to Nana!"                              |
